# Haskel minesweeper game

## Purpose

I've been kinda knowing Haskell a little bit, but I wish to master it more perfectly so this little app is made for kinda practise.

## Installation

You need `haskell-platform` installed.
  
And then do this:

    cabal install ansi-terminal

And then do this:

    runhaskell saper.hs

## Issues

* Flags for marking mines aren't implemented yet
* The initial input is not checked
* Bad code for Haskell standards
